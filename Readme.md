Overview

This repository contains my work for the course project for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning data". 

Raw data

561 unlabeled data points can be found in the x_test.txt. The labels are in the y_test.txt file. The test subjects are in the subject_test.txt file.


The script and tidy dataset

The script called run_analysis.R will merge the test and training sets together. NOTE: The following are required (they are direct downloads)

1) the UCI HAR Dataset must be extracted and..
2) the UCI HAR Dataset must be availble in a directory called "UCI HAR Dataset"

After processing only the Mean and Standard Deviation are labeled and kept, creating a tab-delimited file, "tidy.txt" 

The CodeBook.md explains the code and the final outcome
